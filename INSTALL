2015-09-10 to 2022-03-24

Getting Seq66 requires building the code or going to the
seq66-packages site on GitHub.  The bootstrap setup is primarily
aimed at developers, but is easy to use with the instructions below.
Different versions of the program can be built:

    -   qseq66.  RtMidi version, with a Qt5 user-interface a la Kepler34.
        Native ALSA, JACK MIDI and JACK transport; fall-back to ALSA; support
        for Meta events (Set Tempo and Time Signature).  The official version of
        Seq66, Linux only.  Also builds a Windows/PortMidi version of the
        application.  Built via qmake and suitable for loading in QtCreator
        installed with mingw32 tools.  Supports both Linux and Windows.  To
        build it in Windows, specify the Mingw library and tools when installing
        QtCreator.  There are build issues using qmake on older 32-bit/Qt 5.3
        systems; C++11 somehow cannot be defined.
    -   qpseq66. The same as qseq66, except that the internal "portmidi"
        implementation is used as the MIDI engine.  Requires Qmake to build on
        Linux and Windows.
    -   seq66cli.  A GUI-less version of Seq66, which can run from the
        console or as a daemon, controlled via MIDI and playlists.

    We provide a portable Windows Zip package and a Windows installer in
    the "seq66-packages" project in GitHub.  It is also fairly easy to
    build the Windows version using QtCreator/qmake.

Below are sections for various ways of installing this project by building
from source code:

    -   Quick Install
    -   Advanced Steps
    -   Qmake-based Install (Linux and Windows)

Quick Install:

    The quick install is meant for for those who do not want to install a lot
    of extra developer packages, and want to use the standard "./configure ;
    make ; make install" mantra.  These steps build the default version of
    Seq66, "seq66".

    The "configure" script for the build process means one needs to install
    the various "dev" dependencies.  See the DEPENDENCIES section.  In
    addition, there may be a need to do the following commands, which require
    automake and libtool to be installed:

        $ libtoolize
        $ automake --add-missing

    Grab a Seq66 tarball e.g. seq66-master-rtmidi-0.90.0-1.tar.xz.
    Untar it

        $ ./configure --enable-release --enable-rtmidi
        $ make
        $ sudo make install

    The configure "--enable-release --enable-rtmidi" options are optional,
    since they are the defaults.  This build results in the first executable
    described above, seq66, the same setup created by "./bootstrap -er -rm".
    If any issues occur, please write me through GitHub, or directly at my
    Gmail address.

Advanced Steps:

    These steps are meant for those who want to try the various versions of
    Seq66, and do not mind installing a lot of extra developer software.

   0.  Preload any DEPENDENCIES, as listed at the end of this document.
       However, if some are missing, the configure script will tell you,
       or, at worst, a build error will tell you.

   1.  Check-out the branch you want, if you do not want "master".  Make a
       branch if you want to make changes.  The active branches are "master",
       "playlist", and "qt5_reconcile".  The comand "git branch -a" will
       show other branches not yet deleted.  See GitHub.

   2.  The first thing to do is decide what version of Seq66 you want to
       build.  There are now 5 versions:

       2.   Seq64cli/seq66cli:           ./bootstrap -er -cli
       3.   Seq64qt5/qseq66:             ./bootstrap -er -qt

       (Currently, one can use "-cli" and "-rm" together to build both
       versions in one pass.  However, there are issues still to resolve,
       so do not do it!)
   
       From the top project directory, run one of the commands above (they
       auto-configure) or run the following commands, which set up a release
       build of seq66 (native JACK, native ALSA fallback).

       $ ./bootstrap            (only if the configure script does not exist)
       $ ./configure [options]

       If you do not want to see a lot of output, the stock autotools
       option "--enable-silent-rules" can be added to the ./configure command.
       Otherwise:

       $ ./bootstrap --enable-release [ -rm | -cli | -am | -pm  | -qt ]
       $ ./bootstrap -er [ -rm | -cli | -am | -pm  | -qt ]

       Note that the options in brackets are optional.  The additional options
       select the kind of Seq66 to build.  There is now no default, but
       -rm is most likely what you want, for a Linux build.

       For debugging without libtool getting in the way, just run the
       following command, which will add the --enable-debug and
       --disable-shared options to a configure run:

       $ ./bootstrap --enable-debug [ -rm | -cli | -am | -pm  | -qt ]
       $ ./bootstrap -ed [ -rm | -cli | -am | -pm  | -qt ]

       Other combinations can work.  For example, the following bootstrap
       sets up for debugging and to build both the command-line and
       Qt5/rtmidi application:

       $ ./bootstrap -ed -cli -qt

       There are also configure options as described below, and conditional
       macros in the header files.  The configure options can be supplied to
       the ./configure command, while build macros can be defined (in the
       code) to even further tailor the build.

   3.  Run the make command:

       $ make

       This procedure no longer builds the documentation. If you do care about
       programmer documentation, change to the doc/dox directory and run
       "./make_dox reference" and "./make_dox notes".

       WARNING:  "./make_dox reference" is currently BROKEN, even though
                 no errors/warnings are shown in the Doxygen log files.
      
       You can add options to "make", such as "V=0" (enable silent build),
       "V=1" (enable the normal verbose build), and "-j n" (use n processors
       to speed up the build).

   4.  To install, become root and run:

       # make install

       Note that we have removed the developer reference manual from the
       automated build (see the Doxygen DEPENDENCIES below), but the existing
       documents will still be installed.

   5.  See the additional features that can be enabled, below, using 
       build macros.

   6.  Also grab the Seq66 User Manual from:

            http://github.com/ahlstromcj/seq66-doc.git

       It contains a prebuilt PDF version of the manual, as well as the
       LaTeX files needed to rebuild it.

   7.  If you want to generate your own source/configure tarball for
       distributing Seq66, use the pack script:

       ./pack --release rtmidi 0.94.6

       where rtmidi is the intended default build, and 0.94.6 is the version
       of the project.  The branch is included in the resulting tarball name;
       the usual branch would be "master".

Pipe Option:

    The gcc -pipe option uses pipes, rather than temporary files, for
    communication between the various stages of compilation. This fails to work
    on some systems where the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; the
    GNU assembler can do it.

    $ CFLAGS="-pipe" ./bootstrap -ed

        or

    $ CFLAGS="-pipe" ./configure --enable-debug --disable-shared

    Then do the normal make.

Qmake-based Install:

    A build based on QtCreator and Qmake is available, to build the project on
    Windows, though we created this build on Linux first to work out the
    numerous "gotchas" with QtCreator, QMake, and the internal Seq66
    "architecture".
    
    The Qmake-based build is designed *only* to use the PortMidi library and
    the new Kepler34-based Qt 5 user interface.  This user interface is
    currently similar to the Gtkmm 2.4 user interface, but supports a slightly
    different feature set, and uses the Seq66 libraries internally.

    The first way to use this build is to run QtCreator and load the
    seq66.pro file.  This method can be used if you do not care for the
    command-line.  However, if the installer for QtCreator did not
    set up the default "kit" properly, create a good kit manually.
    If the kit is set up properly, the "seq66.pro" entry in the left
    project panel will show the other "pro" files as subprojects.  Note that
    a successful build will put the generated files in a "shadow" directory
    parallel with the "seq66" directory, such as:
    
        build-seq66-Desktop_Qt_5_10_1_MinGW_32bit-Debug
    
    Do not forget to "Configure Project" before trying to build it!

    The second way to use this build is to just use qmake to do a "shadow
    build".  Assuming you are in the "seq66" directory:

        $ cd ..
        $ mkdir debug-build
        $ cd debug-build
        $ qmake -makefile -recursive "CONFIG += debug" ../seq66/seq66.pro
        $ make
        $ gdb ./Seq66qt/seq66 (for debugging)

    One can also use "CONFIG += release", or just leave that off entirely.
    We get a nice build that works under Linux or Windows.  Currently, we have
    tried only using the "mingw" tools in Windows, not the "msvc" (Microsoft)
    tools.  For debugging, gdb can be used, but QtCreator is an easier
    debugging interface.

    To create an installer package for Windows, see the instructions at the
    top of the "nsis/Seq66Setup.nsi" file. One can build the Seq66
    application in Windows, and then build the installer for it in Windows or
    Linux!

CONFIGURE OPTIONS FOR APPLICATION FEATURES:

    These options define or undefine various build macros:

    --enable-rtmidi

        Defines SEQ66_RTMIDI_SUPPORT to enable our heavily modified "rtmidi"
        library.  This option enables the usage of native JACK MIDI which will
        fall back to ALSA if JACK is not running.  Builds Seq66rtmidi/seq66.

    --enable-alsamidi --disable-rtmidi

        Defines SEQ66_ALSAMIDI_SUPPORT to build the original Seq66.
        This build is not quite the same, since we have refactored the midibus
        and mastermidibus modules, and added the businfo module.  Builds
        Seq66/seq66.  Note that "rtmidi" must be explicitly
        disabled at this time.
        
    --disable-highlight

        Undefines the SEQ66_HIGHLIGHT_EMPTY_SEQS  macro, which is otherwise
        defined by default.  If defined, the application will highlight empty
        sequences/patterns by coloring them yellow. Gtkmm only.

    --enable-lash

        Defines the SEQ66_LASH_SUPPORT macro, which is now undefined
        by default.  Use this if you still use LASH session management.

    --disable-jack
    
        Undefines the SEQ66_JACK_SUPPORT macro, which is otherwise defined
        by default.  This option is not viable for the "rtmidi" version of
        Seq66, which incorporates a couple of JACK modules.

    --disable-jack-session

        Undefines the SEQ66_JACK_SESSION macro, which is defined if JACK
        support is defined, and the jack/session.h file is found.

    --enable-portmidi
    --enable-rtmidi
    --enable-alsamidi

        We have gotten a few alternate implementations to work.  The normal
        build is effectively --enable-rtmidi.  The --enable-portmidi flag
        creates a new application, seq66portmidi, that is based on using ALSA
        on Linux via the PortMidi application.  If we get a nice
        implementation of gtkmm2 for Windows working, we ought to have the
        Windows version we were looking at.  The macros are:

        SEQ66_PORTMIDI_SUPPORT
        SEQ66_RTMIDI_SUPPORT

        They are used only in the --version output.

    --disable-mainscroll

        Undefines SEQ66_JE_PATTERN_PANEL_SCROLLBARS.  This macro enables
        a new scroll-bar feature in the main window, from user jean-emmanuel,
        in preparation for a larger number of patterns in the main window.

    --disable-multiwid

        Undefines SEQ66_MULTI_MAINWID.  This macro enables showing multiple
        main window sets in up to a 3-row by 2-column matrix, with Set
        spinners for each windows, or one for the whole group.  This option
        is not perfect, but can be useful.  Gtkmm only.

MANUALLY-DEFINED MACROS IN CODE:

    The following items are not yet part of the configure script, but can
    be edited manually to achieve the desired settings.  Only crazy or
    experiment-happy people will normally want to change the define-state of
    these macros.  We have consolidated them into a single file,
    libseq66/include/seq66_features.h, to make them easier to find and edit.

    SEQ66_SHOW_COLOR_PALETTE:

        If enabled (will be the default), this feature allows the user to pick
        a color for each sequence, to make it more distinguishable.  The
        default color is NONE (a white color) that is not stored in the track.
        Otherwise, this color is saved in a SeqSpec associated with the track.
        This differs from the Kepler34 implementation, which stores 1024
        color values no matter what.

    SEQ66_SONG_BOX_SELECT:

        This feature is meant to become a permanent part of Seq66
        eventually.  If defined, it allows selecting multiple patterns in the
        Song editor.  Currently, this can be done by selecting a pattern, then
        holding the Shift key while selecting more patterns.  Eventually,
        the ability to box-select mutliple patterns, like Kepler34, will be
        added.  However, this will be a long time in coming, as I have churned
        a lot trying to get it to work.  However, it is available if
        building for Qt support (i.e. SEQ66_QTMIDI_SUPPORT is defined).

    SEQ66_EDIT_SEQUENCE_HIGHLIGHT:

        Provides the option to highlight the currently-editing sequence
        in the main window view and in the song editor.  If the sequence is
        muted, it is highlighted in black text on a cyan background.  If
        it is unmuted, it is highlighted in cyan text on a black background.
        The highlighting follows whichever pattern editor or event editor has
        the focus.

    SEQ66_STAZED_SONG_MODE_BUTTON:

        Enables a Live/Song-mode toggle-button on the main window, so
        that one can choose the mode directly, rather than focussing the
        main window versus the song-editor window.  Comes from the Seq32
        project.

    USE_xxxxxx:
    SEQ66_xxxxxx_TMI:

        This category of macro are usually undefined values that let us keep
        old or experimental code around in case we decide it was the better
        code after all.  Generally, you do not want to change the status of
        these macros unless you are very familiar with the code and willing to
        temporarily break stuff or add annoying console output.
        The "TMI" in some denotes debug code that dumps too much information
        (TMI) to the console, so has to be enabled by editing it on those
        occasions where you really want it.

        We have incorporated some very useful code from the Seq32 project
        of the user "stazed".  He includes some new features and some bug
        fixes that we had overlooked.  At present, we are not enabling this
        functionality, just adding it, macroed out by the following macros:

        USE_STAZED_RANDOMIZE_SUPPORT
        USE_STAZED_SEQDATA_EXTENSIONS
        USE_STAZED_SELECTION_EXTENSIONS
        USE_STAZED_EVEN_ODD_SUPPORT

        Also, the GitHub project "Kepler34" has some features we want to adopt
        before we make our version of its conversion to the Qt library.

        SEQ66_SEQUENCE_EDIT_MODE

REPORTING ISSUES:

   Should one be unfortunate enough to experience a segmentation fault
   (i.e. the infamous "crash"), here is the most complete way to diagnose the
   error, if we cannot replicate it:

        $ ./bootstrap --full-clean
        $ ./bootstrap -ed -rm
        $ make
        $ gdb ./Seq64rtmidi/seq66
        (gdb) r    [add your command-line arguments here if needed]
                   [replicate the crash]
        (gdb) bt   [does a backtrace]

    Then highlight, copy, and paste the stack trace and attach it to the bug
    report.  Might have to Page Up to see the relevant parts of the stack
    trace.

DEPENDENCIES:

   With luck, the following dependencies will bring in their own dependencies
   when installed.

   Code:

      -  libasound2-dev
      -  libjack-jackd2-dev
      -  liblash-compat-dev (optional, needed for LASH support)
      -  liblo-dev (optional, needed for NSM/OSC support)
      -  libpng-dev (replaces libpng12-dev with libpng16, latest Debian Sid,
         and brings in libpng-tools)

   Runtime:

      -  libatk-adaptor (and its dependencies)
      -  libgail-common (and its dependencies)

   Build tools:

      -  automake and autoconf
      -  autoconf-archive
      -  g++
      -  make
      -  libtool
      -  Qt 5.  Install qtcreator only if you want it, as it installs 650 Mb
         worth of files.  One can just install the bare minimum:
         -  qt5-default (Important!)
         -  qtbase5-dev
         -  qtbase5-dev-tools
         -  qtdeclarative-dev-tools or qtdeclarative5-dev-tools
            (qtdeclarative5-dev?)
         -  qtchooser
         -  qt5-qmake
         -  qtdesigner; optional if you want to tweak the GUIs, not huge,
            provided by the qtttools5-dev-tools package in Debian.

         To setup Qt, first run the command "qtchooser -l".  If more than one
         version of Qt is installed, their numbers are all listed.  Make sure
         that "5" is in the list, and then add this line to your .bashrc file:

            export QT_SELECT=5

        This allows builds in bash to use the correct version of Qt.

   Documentation (now optional, must be built manually):

      We have removed the automatic generation of the developer reference
      documentation.  It is a pain to deal with relative to the number of
      times one needs to read it.  To build it, change to the doc/dox
      directory and run "./make_dox reference".  There is now a shorter,
      more useful "Developer Notes" document that can be built using
      "./make_dox notes".  Be aware that the PDF files will always be present
      and installed, even if not necessarily up-to-date with the latest code.

      -  doxygen and doxygen-latex
      -  graphviz
      -  texlive

      To build the documentation manually, change to the doc/dox
      directory and run:

         ./make_dox reference
         ./make_dox clean

      To install the documentation to /usr/local/doc/seq66-0.90:

         ./make_dox install
      
   Debian packaging:

      See the README file in the Debian directory.

      -  debhelper
      -  dh-autoreconf (Perl)
      -  fakeroot

   MingW:

      Avoid use of AC_CYGWIN and AC_MINGW32.

   Other:

     -  git
     -  vim or emacs

   JACK Testing (optional):

      - qjackctl
      - a2jmidid (exposes Seq24 ALSA MIDI ports to JACK)
      - hydrogen
      - klick (a command-line metronome)
      - qtractor or other MIDI sequencers
      - gmidimonitor or (better) midisnoop

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=4 et ft=sh
