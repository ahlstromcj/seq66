 *  The data pane is the drawing-area below the seqedit's event area, and
 *  contains vertical lines whose height matches the value of each data event.
 *  The height of the vertical lines is editable via the mouse.
 *
 *  Another feature. Drawing a circular "grab handle" when an event is
 *  crossed by the mouse or is selected. This is progress on the way to
 *  improving issue #115.
