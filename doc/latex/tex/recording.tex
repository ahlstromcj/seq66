\section{Seq66 Recording In Depth}
\label{sec:recording}

   Recording in \textsl{Seq66} has been greatly enhanced.
   Multiple patterns can be recorded at once, with events
   routed to particular patterns based on either the buss number the event came
   in on, or the channel number.
   Additional ways to toggle recording have been added.
   Additional recording alterations have been added, such as on-the-fly note
   mapping.
   It can get a bit complex to keep track of, hence this section,
   which walks the user through some scenarios.

   Before getting started, note that recording also
   can be done during count-in via the metronome feature.
   See \sectionref{paragraph:menu_edit_preferences_metronom_options}.

\subsection{Recording Scenarios}
\label{sec:recording_scenarios}

   The following recording scenarios are available:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Standard Recording}.
         This provides the normal method of recording. Open a pattern in a
         window and enable recording.
         In this mode the record-button at the bottom of the main window
         is red.
      \item \textbf{Route-by-Bus}.
         In this mode, any pattern that specifies a specific input buss
         can be enabled for recording.
         Incoming events are routed to the first pattern that has an input
         buss matching the buss on which the event was recorded.
         In this mode the record-button at the bottom of the main window
         is green.
      \item \textbf{Record-by-Channel}.
         In this mode, one enables recording in patterns numbered from 0 to 15
         (channels 1 to 16) with output channels set from 0 to 15.
         Incoming events are analyze for their channel and are recording into
         the corresponding pattern.
         In this mode the record-button at the bottom of the main window
         is yellow.
   \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Standard Recording}
\label{subsubsec:recording_standard_recording}

   Standard recording allows the enabling of recording in a single pattern.
   It requires that the other two modes be turned off.
   Once a pattern is set to record, no other pattern can be set to record until
   the original pattern is set to not record.
   The single recording pattern gets all events from any MIDI
   input that is enabled.

   In standard recording there a many ways to enable recording into
   a pattern.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Open the pattern in a window or tab, and click the record
         button at the bottom of the pattern editor.
         It will turn red when enabled. The pattern will also
         show a red circle to indicate that recording has been enabled.
      \item Right-click on the desired pattern in the grid and select
         \textbf{Record toggle} from the menu.
      \item Touch a pattern or click its hot key, then
         click the red record button at the bottom of the main window.
      \item Select the \textbf{RECORD} grid mode, then select a pattern.
         (This option is more useful in the other recording scenarios.)
   \end{itemize}

   Again, remember that, with standard recording, only one pattern can
   accept events.

\subsubsection{Route-By-Buss}
\label{subsubsec:recording_route_by_buss}

   Route-by-buss is enabled whenever a pattern in a song specifies an
   input buss and
   \textbf{Edit / Preferences / MIDI Input / Record into patterns by
   bus} is checked. It is an 'rc' file option.
   If it is enabled, it supercedes the
   \textbf{record-by-channel} option.

   When route-by-bus is enabled, an internal container is populated with
   all the patterns in the current play-set that specify an input buss.
   This container is rebuilt when a sequence is added or removed.
   It is stored in the \texttt{c\_midiinbus} SeqSpec in the song.

   If route-by-bus is enabled, a sequence with an input bus that matches the
   buss associated with the incoming event is looked up, and input is
   streamed to it.

   In this scenario, multiple patterns can be enabled for recording,
   and output from multiple input ports are routed appropriately.

   Clicking on the green record button at the bottom of the main window
   will turn on recording for \textsl{all}
   patterns that specify an input buss.

\subsubsection{Record-By-Channel}
\label{subsubsec:recording_record_by_channel}

   Record-by-channel can be enabled in
   \textbf{Edit / Preferences / MIDI Input / Record into patterns by
   channel}, which is an 'rc' file option.

   It works by routing events to the first pattern that has specified an 
   output (not input) channel that matches the channel (if applicable) of
   the incoming MIDI event.
   The patterns applicable are entered into a list of patterns with specified
   output channels.

   For convenience, there is a MIDI file installed, called
   \textbf{16-blank-patterns}, which specifies all the output channels.
   It can be copied and used for the first recording from a device
   playing on multiple channels, or from multiple devices, each playing
   on a different channel.

   Clicking on the yellow record button at the bottom of the main window
   will turn on recording for \textsl{all}
   patterns that specify an input buss.

   Note that the route-by-buss option, described above, supercedes this
   option.

\subsection{Recording Modes}
\label{sec:recording_modes}

   Recording can also transform (alter) the incoming events.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Tighten}.
         Partial quantization to the current snap value.
      \item \textbf{Quantize}.
         Full quantization to the current snap value.
      \item \textbf{Note-map}.
         If a 'drums' file is active, then notes are changed
         in note-value according to that file.
         This is most useful for drums, but other effects are possible.
   \end{itemize}

   These transformations can also be done after recording.
