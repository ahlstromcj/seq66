# README.md for Seq66 0.99.20 2025-04-12

__Seq66__ MIDI sequencer/live-looper with a hardware-sampler grid interface;
pattern banks, triggers, and playlists for song management; scale and chord
aware piano-roll; song layout for creative composition; control/status via MIDI
automation for live performance.  Mute-groups enable/disable sets of patterns.
Supports the Non/New Session Manager; can also run headless.  Works in a space
as small as 450x340 pixels (if window decoration removed).  It does not support
audio samples, just MIDI.

__Seq66__ A major refactoring of Sequencer64/Kepler34/Seq24 with modern C++ and
new features.  Linux and Windows users can build this application from source
code.  See the extensive INSTALL file.  Includes a comprehensive PDF
user-manual.

Support sites (still in progress):

    *   https://ahlstromcj.github.io/
    *   https://github.com/ahlstromcj/ahlstromcj.github.io/wiki

The release now includes an installer for the 64-bit Windows version of Seq66.
Also included is initial work on getting Seq66 to build and run in FreeBSD using
the Clang compiler.

See NEWS for updates and RELNOTES for highlights.

Current development-in-progress branch: wip.
The figure below shows Seq66 with modified palette and a style-sheet in
force. Otherwise the application uses the current Qt theme.

# Major Features

##  User interface

    *   Qt 5 (cross-platform).  Loop-button gird. Qt style-sheet support.
    *   Drag-and-drop a MIDI file onto the main grid to load it.
    *   Tabs and external windows for patterns, sets, mute-groups, song
        layout, event-editing, play-lists, and session information.
    *   Low-frequency oscillator (LFO) to modify continuous controller
        and velocity values.
    *   A "fixer" for expansion/compression/alignment of note patterns.
    *   Colorable pattern slots; the color palette can be saved and modified.
    *   Horizontal and vertical zoom in the pattern and song editors.
    *   Extremely resizable.
    *   A headless/daemon version can be built.

##  Configuration files

    *   Supports configuration files: '.rc', '.usr', '.ctrl', '.mutes',
        '.playlist', '.drums' (note-mapping), '.palette', and Qt '.qss'.
    *   Separates MIDI control and mute-group setting into their own files.
    *   Unified keystroke and MIDI controls in the '.ctrl' file; defines MIDI
        controls for automation/display of Seq66 status in grid controllers
        (e.g. LaunchPad).  Sample '.ctrl' files provided for Launchpad Mini.

##  Non/New Session Manager

    *   Support for NSM/New Session Manager, RaySession, Agordejo....
    *   Handles starting, stopping, hiding, and session saving.
    *   Displays details about the session.

##  Multiple Builds

    *   ALSA/JACK: `qseq66` using an rtmidi-based library
    *   Command-line/headless: `seq66cli`
    *   PortMidi: `qpseq66`
    *   Windows: `qpseq66.exe`

##  More Features

    *   Supports configurable PPQN from 32 to 19200 (default is 192).
    *   Transposable triggers to re-use patterns more comprehensively.
    *   Song import/export from/to stock MIDI (SMF 0 or 1).
    *   Highly configurable MIDI-based metronome.
    *   Improved non-U.S. keyboard support.
    *   Many demonstration and test MIDI files.
    *   See the **NEWS** file or **RELNOTES**.

##  Internal

    *   More consistent use of modern C++, auto, and lambda functions.
    *   Additional performer callbacks to reduce polling.
    *   A ton of clean-up and refactoring.

Seq66 uses a Qt 5 user-interface based on Kepler34 and the Seq66 *rtmidi*
(Linux) and *portmidi* (Windows) engines.  MIDI devices are detected,
inaccessible devices are ignored, with playback (e.g. to the Windows wavetable
synth). It is built easily via *GNU Autotools*, *Qt Creator* or *qmake*, using
*MingW*.  See the INSTALL file for build-from-source instructions for Linux or
Windows, and using a conventional source tarball.

## Recent Changes

    *   Added a 'usr' option to show an elliptical progress box, as eye candy.
    *   Fixed the writing and byte-counting of the end-of track event. Saved
        Seq66 MIDI files will be one byte longer.
    *   Updated the licensing files to conform to GitHub so that they
        are detected by GitHub.
    *   Fixed some font handling and added edit fields for browser and PDF
        viewer.
    *   Fixed NSM support.
    *   Added support for 120 PPQN and fixed the display of it in the
        pattern editor.
    *   Also see RELNOTES and NEWS.
