 *
 *  A MIDI event (i.e. "track event") is encapsulated by the seq66::event
 *  object.
 *
 *      -   Varinum delta time stamp.
 *      -   Event byte:
 *          -   MIDI event.
 *              -   Channel event (0x80 to 0xE0, channel in low nybble).
 *                  -   Data byte 1.
 *                  -   Data byte 2 (for all but patch and channel pressure).
 *              -   Non-channel event (0xF0 to 0xFF).
 *                  -   SysEx (0xF0), discussed below, includes data bytes.
 *                  -   Song Position (0xF2) includes data bytes.
 *                  -   Song Select (0xF3) includes data bytes.
 *                  -   The rest of the non-channel events don't include data
 *                      byte.
 *          -   Meta event (0xFF).
 *              -   Meta type byte.
 *              -   Varinum length.
 *              -   Data bytes.
 *          -   SysEx event.
 *              -   Start byte (0xF0) or continuation/escape byte (0xF7).
 *              -   Varinum length???
 *              -   Data bytes (not yet fully supported in event class).
 *              -   End byte (0xF7).
 *
 *  Running status is used, where status bytes of MIDI channel messages can be
 *  omitted if the preceding event is a MIDI channel message with the same
 *  status.  Running status continues across delta-times.
 *
 *  In Seq24/Seq66, none of the non-channel events are stored in an
 *  event object.  There is some provisional support for storing SysEx, but
 *  none of the support functions are yet called.  In mastermidibus, there is
 *  support for recording SysEx data, but it is macro'ed out.  In rcsettings,
 *  there is an option for SysEx.  The midibus and performer objects also deal
 *  with Sysex.  But the midifile module does not read it -- it skips SysEx.
 *  Apparently, it does serve as a Thru for incoming SysEx, though.
 *  See this message thread:
 *
 *     http://sourceforge.net/p/seq66/mailman/message/1049609/
 *
 *  In Seq24/Seq66, the Meta events are handled directly, and they
 *  set up sequence parameters.
 *
 *  This module also defines the event::key object.

 *  As noted elsewhere, the song judyblue.mid does not play all notes.
 *  This happens when the Note Off for a preceding note follows
 *  a Note On for the same note number, and these two events have the
 *  same time-stamp.
 *
 *  Enabling this macro gives Note Offs priority over Note Ons with the
 *  same time-stamp, and seems to fix the problem.
 *
 *  However, this breaks, it seems, the recording of notes of the same
 *  note number, so that some notes end up way too long. That's a worse

 *      The less-than operator is supposed to support a "strict weak

 *      save our sample MIDI file, events get reversed.  Here are
 *      program-changes that get reversed:
 *
\verbatim
        Save N:     0070: 6E 00 C4 48 00 C4 0C 00  C4 57 00 C4 19 00 C4 26
        Save N+1:   0070: 6E 00 C4 26 00 C4 19 00  C4 57 00 C4 0C 00 C4 48
\endverbatim
 *
 *      The 0070 is the offset within the versions of the b4uacuse-seq64.midi
 *      file.
 *
 *      Because of this issue, and the very slow speed of loading a MIDI file
 *      when built for debugging, we explored using an std::multimap instead
 *      of an std::list.  This worked better than a list, for loading MIDI
 *      events, but may cause the upper limit of the number of playing
 *      sequences to drop a little, due to the overhead of incrementing
 *      multimap iterators versus list iterators).  Now we use only the
 *      std::vector implementation, slightly faster than using std::list.
 *
 * \param rhs
 *      The object to be compared against.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns true if the time-stamp and "rank" are less than those of the

 *
 *      The record parameter, if true, does not clear channel portion

 *      will be stored without the channel nybble.  This is necessary since
 *      the channel is appended by midibus::play() based on the track.
 *
 *  Instead of adding a "record" parameter to set_status(), we provide a more
 *  specific function, set_status_keep_channel(), for use in the mastermidibus
 *  class.  This usage also has the side-effect of allowing the usage of
 *  channel in the MIDI-control feature.
