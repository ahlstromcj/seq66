/**

 *
 *  This module declares/defines some utility functions and calculations
 *  needed by this application.
 *
 * \library       seq66 application
 * \author        Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2015-11-07

 *
 *  This code was moved from the globals module so that other modules
 *  can include it only if they need it.
 *
 *  To convert the ticks for each MIDI note into a millisecond value to
 *  display the notes visually along a timeline, one needs to use the division
 *  and the tempo to determine the value of an individual tick.  That
 *  conversion looks like:
 *
\verbatim
        1 min    60 sec   1 beat     Z clocks
       ------- * ------ * -------- * -------- = seconds
       X beats   1 min    Y clocks       1
\endverbatim
 *
 *  X is the tempo (beats per minute, or BPM), Y is the division (pulses per
 *  quarter note, PPQN), and Z is the number of clocks from the incoming
 *  event. All of the units cancel out, yielding a value in seconds. The
 *  condensed version of that conversion is therefore:
 *
\verbatim
        (60 * Z) / (X * Y) = seconds
        seconds = 60 * clocks / (bpm * ppqn)
\endverbatim
 *
 *  The value given here in seconds is the number of seconds since the
 *  previous MIDI event, not from the sequence start.  One needs to keep a
 *  running total of this value to construct a coherent sequence.  Especially
 *  important if the MIDI file contains tempo changes.  Leaving the clocks (Z)
 *  out of the equation yields the periodicity of the clock.
 *
 *  The inverse calculation is:
 *
\verbatim
        clocks = seconds * bpm * ppqn / 60
\endverbatim
 *
 * \todo
 *      There are additional user-interface and MIDI scaling variables in the
 *      perfroll module that we need to move here.

 *  "0:0:0" as one might expect.

 *  If we get a 0 for measures or for beats, we

 *
 *  We should consider clamping the beats to the beat-width value as well.
 *
 *  Example: Current time-signature = 3/16. Then q_per_beat = 4/16 = 0.25.
 *  For 1 measure and 3 beats, the pulses are p = 1 * 3 * 0.25 * PPQN. If PPQN

 *
 * \param measures
 *      Provides the current MIDI song time structure holding the
 *      measures, beats, and divisions values for the time of interest.
 *      Note that it does not employ beat-width. It is a time position.
 *
 * \param seqparms
 *      This small structure provides the beats/minute, beats/measure,
 *      beat-width, and PPQN that hold for the sequence in this calculation.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns the absolute pulses that mark this duration.  If the
 *      pulse-value cannot be calculated, then c_null_midipulse is
