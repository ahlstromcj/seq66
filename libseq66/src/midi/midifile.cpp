 *
 *  For a quick guide to the MIDI format, see, for example:
 *
 *  http://www.mobilefish.com/tutorials/midi/midi_quickguide_specification.html
 *
 *  It is important to note that most sequencers have taken a shortcut or two
 *  in reading the MIDI format.  For example, most will silently ignored an
 *  unadorned control tag (0x242400nn) which has not been packaged up as a
 *  proper sequencer-specific meta event.  The midicvt program
 *  (https://github.com/ahlstromcj/midicvt, derived from midicomp, midi2text,
 *  and mf2t/t2mf) does not ignore this lack of a SeqSpec wrapper, and hence
 *  we decided to provide a new, more strict input and output format for the
 *  the "proprietary"/SeqSpec track in Seq66.
 *
 *  Elements written:
 *
 *      -   MIDI header.
 *      -   Tracks.
 *          These items are then written, preceded by the "MTrk" tag and
 *          the track size.
 *          -   Sequence number.
 *          -   Sequence name.
 *          -   Time-signature and tempo (track 0 only)
 *          -   Sequence events.
 *
 *  Items handled in midi_vector_base:
 *
 *      -   Key signature.  Although Seq66 does not create or use this
 *          event, if present, it is preserved so that it can be written out
 *          to the file when saved.
 *      -   Time signature.
 *      -   Tempo.
 *      -   Sequence number.
 *      -   Track end.
 *      -   Seq66-specific SeqSpec data.
 *
 *  Uses the new format for the Seq66 footer section of the Seq24 MIDI
 *  file.
 *
 *  In the new format, each sequencer-specfic value (0x242400xx) is preceded
 *  by the sequencer-specific prefix, 0xFF 0x7F len). By default, the new
 *  format is used.  In Seq66, the old format is no longer supported.
 *
 * Running status:
 *
 *      A recommended approach for a receiving device is to maintain its
 *      "running status buffer" as so:
 *
 *      -#  Buffer is cleared (ie, set to 0) at power up.
 *      -#  Buffer stores the status when a Voice Category Status (ie, 0x80
 *          to 0xEF) is received.
 *      -#  Buffer is cleared when a System Common Category Status (ie, 0xF0
 *          to 0xF7) is received.
 *      -#  Nothing is done to the buffer when a RealTime Category message is
 *          received.
 *      -#  Any data bytes are ignored when the buffer is 0.

/**
 *  Principal constructor.

 * \param name
 *      Provides the name of the MIDI file to be read or written.
 *
 * \param ppqn
 *      Provides the initial value of the PPQN setting.  It is handled
 *      differently for parsing (reading) versus writing the MIDI file.
 *      WARNING: It is the responsibility of the caller to make sure the PPQN
 *      value is valid, usually by passing in the result of the choose_ppqn()
 *      function.
 *      -   Reading.  The caller of read_midi_file(), as well as the function
 *          itself, determine the value of ppqn used here.  It is either 0 or
 *          the result of seq66::choose_ppqn().
 *          -   If usr().use_file_ppqn() is true, then m_ppqn is set to the
 *              value read from the MIDI file.  No PPQN scaling is done.
 *          -   Otherwise, the ppqn value is used as is.  If the file uses a
 *              different PPQN than the default, PPQN rescaling is done to
 *              make it so.  The PPQN value read from the MIDI file is used to
 *              scale the running-time of the track relative to
 *              usr().default_ppqn().
 *      -   Writing.  This value is written to the MIDI file in the header
 *          chunk of the song.  Note that the caller must query for the
 *          PPQN set during parsing, and pass it to the constructor when
 *          preparing to write the file.  See how it is done in the qsmainwnd
 *          class.
 *
 * \param globalbgs
 *      If true, write any non-default values of the key, scale, and
 *      background sequence to the global "proprietary" section of the MIDI
 *      file, instead of to each sequence.  Note that this option is only used
 *      in writing; reading can handle either format transparently. Depends on
 *      usr().global_seq_feature() returning true.
 *
 * \param verifymode
 *      If set to true, we are opening files just to verify them before
 *      accepting the usage of a playlist.  In this case, we clear out each
 *      song after it is read in for verification.  It defaults to false.
 *      Actually, the playlist::verify() function clears the song, but this
 *      variable is still useful to cut down on output during verfication.
 *      See grab_input_stream().

 *  encoding, which does not use the MIDI VLV encoding at all.  The bytes are
 *  stored conventionally.
 *
 *  We also want to be able to support counts other than 1024 (32 groups x 32

/**
 *  This function opens a binary MIDI file and parses it into sequences

 *
 *  In addition to the standard MIDI track data in a normal track,
 *  Seq24/Seq66 adds four sequencer-specific events just before the end
 *  of the track:
 *
\verbatim
    c_midibus:          SeqSpec FF 7F 05 24 24 00 01 00
    c_midichannel:      SeqSpec FF 7F 05 24 24 00 02 06
    c_timesig:          SeqSpec FF 7F 06 24 24 00 06 04 04
    c_triggers_ex:      SeqSpec FF 7F 1C 24 24 00 08 00 00 ...
    c_trig_transpose:   SeqSpec FF 7F 1C 24 24 00 20 00 00 ...
\endverbatim
 *
 *  Note that only Seq66 adds "FF 7F len" to the SeqSpec data.
 *
 *  Standard MIDI provides for port and channel specification meta events, but
 *  they are considered obsolete. They were meant to change port and
 *  channel on the fly during playback, apparently
 *
\verbatim
    Obsolete meta-event:                Replacement:
    MIDI port (buss):   FF 21 01 po     Device (port) name: FF 09 len text
    MIDI channel:       FF 20 01 ch
\endverbatim
 *
 *  What do other applications use for specifying port/channel?
 *
 *  Note the is-modified flag:  We now assume that the performer object is
 *  starting from scratch when parsing.  But we let mainwnd tell the performer
 *  object when to clear everything with performer::clear_all().  The mainwnd
 *  does this for a new file, opening a file, but not for a file import, which
 *  might be done simply to add more MIDI tracks to the current composition.
 *  So, if parsing succeeds, all we want to do is make sure the flag is set.
 *  Parsing a file successfully is not always a modification of the setup.
 *  For instance, the first read of a MIDI file should start clean, not dirty.
 *
 * SysEx notes:
 *
 *      Some files (e.g. Dixie04.mid) do not always encode System Exclusive
 *      messages properly for a MIDI file.  Instead of a varinum length value,
 *      they are followed by extended IDs (0x7D, 0x7E, or 0x7F).
 *
 *      THE ABOVE IS WRONG!
 *
 *      We've covered some of those cases by disabling access to m_data if the
 *      position passes the size of the file, but we want try to bypass these
 *      odd cases properly.  So we look ahead for one of these special values.
 *
 *      Currently, Seq66, like Se24, handles SysEx message only to the
 *      extend of passing them via MIDI Thru.  We hope to improve on that
 *      capability eventually.
 *
 * \param p
 *      Provides a reference to the performer object into which sequences/tracks
 *      are to be added.
 *
 * \param screenset
 *      The screen-set offset to be used when loading a sequence (track) from
 *      the file.  This value ranges from -31 to 0 to +31 (32 is the maximum
 *      screen-set available in Seq24).  This offset is added to the sequence
 *      number read in for the sequence, to place it elsewhere in the imported
 *      tune, and locate it in a specific screen-set.  If this parameter is
 *      non-zero, then we will assume that the performer data is dirty. The
 *      default is 0.
 *
 * \param importing
 *      Indicates that we are importing a file, and do not want to parse/erase
 *      any "proprietrary" information from the performance.  Defaults to false.
 *      Also will flag a modification.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns true if the parsing succeeded.  Note that the error status is
 *      saved in m_error_is_fatal, and a message (to display later) is saved
 *      in m_error_message.

/**
 *  This function parses an SMF 1 binary MIDI file; it is basically the
 *  original seq66 midifile::parse() function.  It assumes the file-data has
 *  already been read into memory.  It also assumes that the ID, track-length,
 *  and format have already been read.
 *
 *  If the MIDI file contains both proprietary (c_timesig) and MIDI type 0x58
 *  then it came from seq42 or seq32 (Stazed versions).  In this case the MIDI
 *  type is parsed first (because it is listed first) then it gets overwritten
 *  by the proprietary, above.
 *
 *  Note that track_count doesn't count the Seq24 "proprietary" footer
 *  section, even if it uses the new format, so that section will still be
 *  read properly after all normal tracks have been processed.
 *
 * PPQN:
 *
 *      Current time (runningtime) is re the ppqn according to the file, we
 *      have to adjust it to our own ppqn.  PPQN / ppqn gives us the ratio.
 *      (This change is not enough; a song with a ppqn of 120 plays too fast
 *      in Seq24, which has a constant ppqn of 192.  Triggers must also be
 *      modified.)
 *
 * Tempo events:
 *
 *      If valid, set the global tempo to the first encountered tempo; this is
 *      legacy behavior.  Bad tempos occur and stick around, munging exported
 *      songs.  We log only the first tempo officially; the rest are stored as
 *      events if in the first track.  We also adjust the upper draw-tempo
 *      range value to about twice this value, to give some headroom... it
 *      will not be saved unless the --user-save option is in force.
 *
 * Channel:
 *
 *      We are transitioning away from preserving the channel in the status
 *      byte, which will require using the event::m_channel value.
 *
 * Time Signature:
 *
 *      Like Tempo, Time signature is now handled more robustly.
 *
 * Key Signature and other Meta events:
 *
 *      Although we don't support these events, we do want to keep them, so we
 *      can output them upon saving.  Instead of bypassing unhandled Meta
 *      events, we now store them, so that they are not lost when
 *      exporting/saving the MIDI data.
 *
 * Track name:
 *
 *      This event is optional. It's interpretation depends on its context. If
 *      it occurs in the first track of a format 0 or 1 MIDI file, then it
 *      gives the Sequence Name. Otherwise it gives the Track Name.
 *
 * End of Track:
 *
 *      "If delta is 0, then another event happened at the same time as
 *      track-end.  Class sequence discards the last note.  This fixes that.
 *      A native Seq24 file will always have a delta >= 1." Not true!  We've
 *      fixed the real issue by commenting the code that increments current
 *      time.  Question:  What if BPM is set *after* this event?
 *
 * Sequences:
 *
 *      If the sequence is shorter than a quarter note, assume it needs to be
 *      padded to a measure.  This happens anyway if the short pattern is
 *      opened in the sequence editor (seqedit).
 *
 *      Add sorting after reading all the events for the sequence.  Then add
 *      the sequence with it's preferred location as a hint.
 *
 * Unknown chunks:
 *
 *      Let's say we don't know what kind of chunk it is.  It's not a MTrk, we
 *      don't know how to deal with it, so we just eat it.  If this happened
 *      on the first track, it is a fatal error.
 *
 * \param p
 *      Provides a reference to the performer object into which sequences/tracks
 *      are to be added.
 *
 * \param screenset
 *      The screen-set offset to be used when loading a sequence (track) from
 *      the file.
 *
 * \param convert_smf0
 *      True if we detected that the MIDI file is in SMF 0 format and we
 *      want to convert it to SMF 1.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns true if the parsing succeeded.

 *
\verbatim
        0x00 0xFF 0x7F length data
\endverbatim
 *
 *  For convenience, this function first checks the amount of file data left.
 *  If enough, then it reads a long value.  If the value starts with 0x00 0xFF
 *  0x7F, then that is a SeqSpec event, which signals usage of the new
 *  Seq66 "proprietary" format.  Otherwise, it is probably the old
 *  format, and the long value is a control tag (0x242400nn), which can be
 *  returned immedidately.
 *
 *  If it is the new format, we back up to the FF, then get the next byte,
 *  which should be a 7F.  If so, then we read the length (a variable
 *  length value) of the data, and then read the long value, which should
 *  be the control tag, which, again, is returned by this function.
 *
 * \note
 *      Most sequencers seem to be tolerant of both the lack of an "MTrk"
 *      marker and of the presence of an unwrapped control tag, and so can
 *      handle both the old and new formats of the final proprietary track.
 *
 * \param file_size
 *      The size of the data file.  This value is compared against the
 *      member m_pos (the position inside m_data[]), to make sure there is
 *      enough data left to process.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns the control-tag value found.  These are the values, such as
 *      c_midichannel, found in the midi_vector_base module, that indicate the
 *      type of sequencer-specific data that comes next.  If there is not

/**
 *  After all of the conventional MIDI tracks are read, we're now at the
 *  "proprietary" Seq24 data section, which describes the various features
 *  that Seq24 supports.  It consists of series of tags, layed out in the
 *  midi_vector_base.hpp header file (search for c_mutegroups, for example).
 *
 *  The format is (1) tag ID; (2) length of data; (3) the data.
 *
 *  First, we separated out this function for a little more clarity.  Then we
 *  added code to handle reading both the legacy Seq24 format and the new,
 *  MIDI-compliant format.  Note that even the new format is not quite
 *  correct, since it doesn't handle a MIDI manufacturer's ID, making it a
 *  single byte that is part of the data.  But it does have the "MTrk" marker
 *  and track name, so that must be processed for the new format.
 *
 *  Now, in our "midicvt" project, we have a test MIDI file,
 *  b4uacuse-non-mtrk.midi that is good, except for having a tag "MUnk"
 *  instead of "MTrk".  We should consider being more permissive, if possible.
 *  Otherwise, though, the only penality is that the "proprietary" chunk is
 *  completely skipped.
 *
 * Extra precision BPM:
 *
 *  Based on a request for two decimals of precision in beats-per-minute, we
 *  now save a scaled version of BPM.  Our supported range of BPM is 2.0 to
 *  600.0.  If this range is encountered, the value is read as is.  If greater
 *  than this range (actually, we use 999 as the limit), then we divide the
 *  number by 1000 to get the actual BPM, which can thus have more precision
 *  than the old integer value allowed.  Obviously, when saving, we will
 *  multiply by 1000 to encode the BPM.
 *
 * \param p
 *      The performance object that is being set via the incoming MIDI file.
 *
 * \param file_size
 *      The file size as determined in the parse() function.
 *
 *  There are also implicit parameters, with the m_pos member
 *  variable.

/**
 *  Writes a MIDI Variable-Length Value (VLV), which has a variable number
 *  of bytes.
 *
 *  A MIDI file Variable Length Value is stored in bytes. Each byte has
 *  two parts: 7 bits of data and 1 continuation bit. The highest-order
 *  bit is set to 1 if there is another byte of the number to follow. The
 *  highest-order bit is set to 0 if this byte is the last byte in the
 *  VLV.
 *
 *  To recreate a number represented by a VLV, first you remove the
 *  continuation bit and then concatenate the leftover bits into a single
 *  number.
 *
 *  To generate a VLV from a given number, break the number up into 7 bit
 *  units and then apply the correct continuation bit to each byte.
 *  Basically this is a base-128 system where the digits range from 0 to 7F.
 *
 *  In theory, you could have a very long VLV number which was quite
 *  large; however, in the standard MIDI file specification, the maximum
 *  length of a VLV value is 5 bytes, and the number it represents can not
 *  be larger than 4 bytes.
 *
 *  Here are some common cases:
 *
 *      -   Numbers between 0 and 127 are represented by a single byte:
 *          0x00 to 7F.
 *      -   0x80 is represented as 0x81 00.  The first number is
 *          10000001, with the left bit being the continuation bit.
 *          The rest of the number is multiplied by 128, and the second byte
 *          (0) is added to that. So 0x82 would be 0x81 0x01
 *      -   The largest 2-byte MIDI value (e.g. a sequence number) is
 *          0xFF 7F, which is 127 * 128 + 127 = 16383 = 0x3FFF.
 *      -   The largest 3-byte MIDI value is 0xFF FF 7F = 2097151 = 0x1FFFFF.
 *      -   The largest number, 4 bytes, is 0xFF FF FF 7F = 536870911 =
 *          0xFFFFFFF.
 *
 *  Also see the varinum_size() and midi_vector_base::add_variable() functions.
 *
 * \param value
 *      The long value to be encoded as a MIDI varinum, and written to the
 *      MIDI file.

/**
 *  Write the whole MIDI data and Seq24 information out to a MIDI file, writing
 *  out patterns based on their song/performance information (triggers) and
 *  ignoring any patterns that are muted.
 *
 *  We get the number of active tracks, and we don't count tracks with no
 *  triggers, or tracks that are muted.
 *
 *  This function, write_song(), was not included in Seq24 because it
 *  Seq24 writes standard MIDI files (with SeqSpec information that a
 *  decent sequencer should ignore).  But we believe this is a good feature
 *  for export, and created the Export Song command to do this.  The
 *  write_song() function doesn't count tracks that are muted or that have no
 *  triggers.  For sequences that have triggers, it adds the events in order,
 *  to create a long sequence that plays as if the triggers are present.
 *
 * Stazed/Seq32:
 *
 *      The sequence trigger is not part of the standard MIDI format and is
 *      proprietary to seq32/seq66.  It is added here because the trigger
 *      combining has an alternative benefit for editing.  The user can split,
 *      slice and rearrange triggers to form a new sequence. Then mute all
 *      other tracks and export to a temporary MIDI file. Now they can import
 *      the combined triggers/sequence as a new item. This makes editing of
 *      long improvised sequences into smaller or modified sequences as well as
 *      combining several sequence parts painless.  Also, if the user has a
 *      variety of common items such as drum beats, control codes, etc that can
 *      be used in other projects, this method is very convenient. The common
 *      items can be kept in one file and exported all, individually, or in
 *      part by creating triggers and muting.
 *
 *  Write out the exportable tracks.  Note that we don't need to check the
 *  sequence pointer.  We need to use the same criterion we used to count the
 *  tracks in the first place, not just if the track is active and unmuted.
 *  Also, since we already know that an exportable track is valid, no need to
 *  check for a null pointer.
 *
 *  For each trigger in the sequence, add events to the list below; fill
 *  one-by-one in order, creating a single long sequence.  Then set a single
 *  trigger for the big sequence: start at zero, end at last trigger end with
 *  snap.  We're going to reference (not copy) the triggers now, since the
 *  write_song() function is now locked.
 *
 *  The we adjust the sequence length to snap to the nearest measure past the
 *  end.  We fill the MIDI container with trigger "events", and then the
 *  container's bytes are written.
 *
 * \param p
 *      Provides the object that will contain and manage the entire
 *      performance.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns true if the write operations succeeded.  If false is returned,
 *      then m_error_message will contain a description of the error.

/**
 *  Writes out the final proprietary/SeqSpec section, using the new format.

 *  of this big section of data.  This was quite tricky; we tweaked and
 *  adjusted until the midicvt program handled the whole new-format file
 *  without emitting any errors.
 *
 *  Here's the basics of what Seq24 did for writing the data in this part of
 *  the file:
 *
 *      -#  Write the c_midictrl value, then write a 0.  To us, this looks like
 *          no one wrote any code to write this data.  And yet, the parsing
 *          code can handles a non-zero value, which is the number of sequences
 *          as a long value, not a byte.  So shouldn't we write 4 bytes, not
 *          one?  Yes, indeed, we made a mistake.  However, we should be
 *          writing out the full data set as well.  But not even Seq24 does
 *          that!  Perhaps they decided it was best kept in the "rc"
 *          configuration file.
 *      -#  MORE TO COME.
 *
 *  We need a way to make the group mute data optional.  Why write 4096 bytes
 *  of zeroes?
 *
 * \param p
 *      Provides the object that will contain and manage the entire
 *      performance.
 *
 * \return
 *      Always returns true.  No efficient way to check all of the writes that
 *      can happen.  Might revisit this issue if some bug crops up.
