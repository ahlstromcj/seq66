/**
 * \file          midi_vector_base.cpp
 *
 *  This module declares a class for holding and managing MIDI data.
 *
 * \library       seq66 application
 * \author        Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2015-10-10 (as midi_container.cpp)
 * \updates       2023-12-12
 * \license       GNU GPLv2 or above
 *
 *  This class is important when writing the MIDI and sequencer data out to a
 *  MIDI file.  The data handled here are specific to a single
 *  sequence/pattern/track.
 *
 *  Provides tags used by the midifile class to control the reading and
 *  writing of the extra "proprietary" information stored in a Seq24 MIDI
 *  file.  Some of the information is stored with each track (and in the
 *  midi_vector_base-derived classes), and some is stored in the proprietary
 *  header.
 *
 *  Track (sequencer-specific) data:
 *
\verbatim
            c_midibus
            c_midichannel
            c_timesig
            c_triggers (deprecated)
            c_triggers_ex (deprecated)
            c_trig_transpose (c_triggers_ex plus!)
            c_musickey (can be in footer, as well)
            c_musicscale (ditto)
            c_backsequence (ditto)
            c_transpose
            c_seq_color (performance colors for a sequence)
            c_seq_edit_mode (unused by Seq66)
            c_seq_loopcount
            c_midiinbus (new)
\endverbatim
 *
 *  Note that c_seq_color in Seq66 is stored per sequence, and only if
 *  not PaletteColor::NONE.  In Kepler34, all 1024 sequence colors are stored
 *  in a "proprietrary", whole-song section, whether used or not.  There are
 *  also numeric differences in many of these "c_feature" constants.
 *
 * Footer ("proprietary", whole-song) data:
 *
\verbatim
            c_midictrl
            c_midiclocks
            c_notes
            c_bpmtag (beats per minute)
            c_mutegroups
            c_perf_bp_mes (perfedit's beats-per-measure setting)
            c_perf_bw     (perfedit's beat-width setting)
            c_tempo_map   (seq32's tempo map)
            c_midiinbus
            c_reserved_2
            c_tempo_track (holds the song's particular tempo track)
\endverbatim
 *
 *  Also see the PDF file in the following project for more information about
 *  the "proprietary" data:
 *
 *      https://github.com/ahlstromcj/seq66-doc.git
 *
 *  Note that the track data is read from the MIDI file, but not written
 *  directly to the MIDI file.  Instead, it is stored in the MIDI container as
 *  sequences are edited to used these "sequencer-specific" features.
 *  Also note that c_triggers has been replaced by c_triggers_ex as the code
 *  that marks the triggers stored with a sequence. And c_trig_transpose
 *  extends it even further with a byte-value for transposing a trigger.
 *
 *  As an extension, we can also grab the key, scale, and background sequence
 *  value selected in a sequence and write these values as track data, where
 *  they can be read in and applied to a specific sequence, when the seqedit
 *  object is created.  These values would not be stored in the legacy format.
 *
 *  Something like this could be done in the "user" configuration file, but
 *  then the key and scale would apply to all songs.  We don't want that.
 *
 *  We could also add snap and note-length to the per-song defaults, but
 *  the "user" configuration file seems like a better place to store these
 *  preferences.
 *
 * \note
 *      -   The value c_transpose value is from Stazed's seq32 project.
 *          The code to support this option is turned on permanently.
 *          There are additional values from Stazed/seq32, not yet used.
 *      -   The values below are compatible with Seq32, but they are not
 *          compatible with Kepler34.  It uses 0x24240011 and 0x24240012 for
 *          difference purposes.  See the asterisks below.
 *      -   Note the new "gap" values.  We just noticed this gap, which has
 *          existed between 0x24240009 and 0x24240010 since Seq24!

/**
 *  This function fills the given track (sequence) with MIDI data from the
 *  current sequence, preparatory to writing it to a file.  Note that some of
 *  the events might not come out in the same order they were stored in (we
 *  see that with program-change events).  This function replaces
 *  sequence::fill_list().
 *
 *  Now, for sequence 0, an alternate format for writing the sequencer number
 *  chunk is "FF 00 00".  But that format can only occur in the first track,
 *  and the rest of the tracks then don't need a sequence number, since it is
 *  assumed to increment.  This application doesn't use that shortcut.
 *
 *  We have noticed differences in saving files in sets=4x8 versus sets=8x8,
 *  and pre-sorting the event list gets rid of some of the differences, except
 *  for the last, multi-line SeqSpec.  Some event-reordering still seems to
 *  occur, though.
 *
 * Stazed:
 *
 *      The "stazed" (seq32) code implements a function like this one
 *      using a function sequence::fill_proprietary_list() that we
 *      don't need for our implementation... it is part of our
 *      midi_vector_base::fill() function.
 *
 * Triggers:
 *
 *      Triggers are added by first calling add_varinum(0), which is needed
 *      because why?
 *
 *      Then 0xFF 0x7F is written, followed by the length value, which is the
 *      number of triggers at 3 long integers per trigger, plus the 4-byte
 *      code for triggers, c_triggers_ex = 0x24240008.
 *
 *      However, we're now extending triggers (c_trig_transpose = 0x24240020)
 *      to include a transposition byte which allows up to 5 octaves of
 *      tranposition either way, as a way to re-use patterns.  Inspired by
 *      Kraftwerk's "Europe Endless" background sequence, with patterns being
 *      shifted up and down in pitch.
 *
 * Meta and SysEx Events:
 *
 *      These events can now be detected and added to the list of bytes to
 *      dump.  However, historically Seq24 has forced Time Signature and Set
 *      Tempo events to be written to the container, and has ignored these
 *      events (after the first occurrence).  So we need to figure out what to
 *      do here yet; we need to distinguish between forcing these events and
 *      them being part of the edit.
 *
 * \threadunsafe
 *      The sequence object bound to this container needs to provide the
 *      locking mechanism when calling this function.
 *
 * \param track
 *      Provides the track number, re 0.  This number is masked into the track
 *      information.
 *
 * \param p
 *      The performance object that will hold some of the parameters needed
 *      when filling the MIDI container.  Not used!!!
 *
 * \param doseqspec
 *      If true (the default), writes out the SeqSpec information.  If false,
 *      we want to write out a regular MIDI track without this information; it
 *      writes a smaller file.
