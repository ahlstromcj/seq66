/**
 * \file          eventlist.hpp
 *
 *  This module provides a stand-alone module for the event-list container
 *  used by the application.
 *
 * \library       seq66 application
 * \author        Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2015-09-19
 * \updates       2025-06-14
 * \license       GNU GPLv2 or above
 *
 *  This module extracts the event-list functionality from the sequencer
 *  module, so that it is easier to try to replace it with some better
 *  container later.
 *
 *  List versus Map:  #if defined or derivation from an interface?  For our
 *  purposes, #if defined might be simplest, and we only want to pick the
 *  fastest one, ultimately.
 *
 *  It turns out the the std::multimap implementation is a little bit faster
 *  in release mode, and a lot faster in debug mode.  Why?  Probably because
 *  the std::list implementation calls std::list::sort() a lot, and the
 *  std::multimap implementation is a lot faster at sorting.  But since the
 *  map iterator is slower, we stick with std::list.
 *
 *  But, based on this article:
 *
 * https://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2012/12/cpp-benchmark-vector-list-deque.html
 *
 *  we will now use std::vector for the event list.

/**
 *  We made some fixes for sequencer64 issue #141 to disable saving the tempo
 *  into first track. But for Seq66, we do want to be able to save the
 *  time signature(s) of each pattern with that pattern (especially if
 *  different from the global time signature). Note that we would support
 *  only one time-signature per pattern, but unlimited tempo changes.
 *  Also note that, unlike tempo, time-signature does not affect the playback
 *  of MIDI events. It changes how they are displayed.

 *
 *  There is sometimes a segfault when one song is opened with pattern editors
 *  up, and then another song is loaded. So we're defining it to see if
