/**
 * \file          midibytes.hpp
 *
 *  This module declares a number of useful aliases (in place of the old C++
 *  stand-by for type definition).
 *
 * \library       seq66 application
 * \author        Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2018-11-09
 * \updates       2025-06-20
 * \license       GNU GPLv2 or above
 *
 *  These alias specifications are intended to remove the ambiguity we have
 *  seen between signed and unsigned values.  MIDI bytes and pulses, ticks, or
 *  clocks are, by their nature, unsigned, and we should enforce that.
 *
 *  One minor issue is why we didn't tack on "_t" to most of these types, to
 *  adhere to C conventions.  Well, no real reason except to save a couple
 *  characters and save some beauty.  Besides, it is easy to set up vim to
 *  highlight these new types in a special color, making them stand out easily
 *  while reading the code.
 *
 *  Also included are some small classes for encapsulating MIDI timing
 *  information.
