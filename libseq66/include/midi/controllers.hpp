/**
 *  This enumeration summarizes the MIDI Continuous Controllers (CC) that are
 *  available.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *  For balance and pan: 0 = hard left, 64 = center, 127 = hard right
 *
 *  For all on/off switches, 0 to 63 = Off and 64 to 127 = On.
 *
 *  Damper Pedal 64 versus Sostenuto CC 66:
 *
 *      Sustain is a pedal on/off switch that controls sustain.  Sostenuto is
 *      an on/off switch like the Sustain controller (CC 64), but it only holds
 *      notes that were on when the pedal was pressed.  People use it to “hold”
 *      chords” and play melodies over the held chord.
 *
 *  NRPN 98 and 99: Non-Registered Parameter Number LSB and MSB. For
 *  controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the NRPN parameter.
 *
 *  RPN 100 and 101: Registered Parameter Number LSB and MSB. For controllers
 *  6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the RPN parameter.
 *
 *  Local On/Off Switch 122: Turns the internal connection of a MIDI
 *  keyboard/workstation, etc., On or Off.  For a computer, one will most
 *  likely want Local Control off to avoid notes being played twice, once
 *  locally and twice when the note is sent back from the computer to your
 *  keyboard.
 *
 *  All Notes Off 123: Mutes all sounding notes. Release time will be
 *  maintained, and notes held by sustain will not turn off until sustain pedal
 *  is depressed.
 *
 *  Undefined values summary: 3, 9, 14-15, 20-31, 85-90, and 102-119.
 *
 *  Values 32 to 63 are for Controllers 0 to 31, the Least Significant Bit
 *  (LSB).
