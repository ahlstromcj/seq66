/**

 *  This module declares/defines the base class for mutexes.

 *
 *  This module defines the following classes:
 *
 *      -   seq66::mutex.  An alias for std::recursive_mutex.
 *      -   seq66::automutex. A way to lock a function exception-safely and
 *          easily.

namespace seq66
{

/**
 *  Provides a mutex that locks automatically when created, and unlocks
 *  when destroyed.  This has a couple of benefits.  First, it is threadsafe
 *  in the face of exception handling.  Secondly, it can be done with just one
 *  line of code.
 *
 *  It could potentially be replaced by std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> or
 *  std::lock_guard<seq66::mutex>.  However, it provides lock() and unlock()
 *  functions for extra flexibility and danger.  :-)
 *
 *  How to use it? An example:
 *
 *                  int test_func (recmutex & mut, const sequence & s)
 *                  {
 *  Created ----------> automutex locker(mut);
 *  Value to return --> return s.events().count();
 *  Destroyed ----> }
 *
 *  Quoting the standard (ยง3.7.3/3): "If a variable with automatic storage
 *  duration has initialization or a destructor with side effects, it shall
 *  not be destroyed before the end of its block, nor shall it be eliminated
 *  as an optimization even if it appears to be unused." The end of the block,
 *  for a function, is after the return statement.
