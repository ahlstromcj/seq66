/**

 *
 *  This module declares/defines just some of the global (gasp!) variables
 *  in this application.
 *
 * \library       seq66 application
 * \author        Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2015-09-22

 *
 *  This module defines the following categories of "global" variables that
 *  are good to collect in one place, especially for settings stored in the
 *  'usr' configuration file (<code> seq66.usr </code>):
 *
 *      -   The [user-midi-bus] settings, collected in the usermidibus
 *          class.
 *      -   The [use-instrument] settings, collected in the usrinstrument
 *          class.
 *      -   The [user-interface-settings] settings, a small collection of
 *          variables that describe some facets of the "Patterns Panel" or
 *          "Sequences Window", which is visually presented by the
 *          Gtk::Window-derived class called mainwnd.  These variables define
 *          the limits and resolution of various MIDI-to-GUI and application
 *          control parameters.
 *      -   The [user-midi-settings] settings, a collection of variables that
 *          will replaced hard-wired global MIDI parameters with modifiable
 *          parameters better suited to a range of MIDI files.
 *
 *  The Patterns Panel contains an 8-by-4 grid of "pattern boxes" or
 *  "sequence boxes".  All of the patterns in this grid comprise what is
 *  called a "set" (in the musical sense) or a "screen set".
 *
 *  We want to be able to change these defaults.  We will let you know when we
 *  are finished, and what you can do with these variables.
