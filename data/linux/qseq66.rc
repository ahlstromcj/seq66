# Seq66 0.99.6 main ('rc') configuration file

# Written 2023-12-10 11:13:55
#
# This file holds the main configuration for Seq66. It no longer follows the
# format of the seq24rc configuration file.
#
# 'version' is set by Seq66; it is used to detect older configuration files,
# which are upgraded to the new version when saved.
#
# 'quiet' suppresses start-up error messages. Useful when they are not
# relevant. There's no --quiet command-line option yet. It's NOT the opposite
# of 'verbose'.
#
# 'verbose' is temporary, same as --verbose; it's set to false at exit.
#
# 'sets-mode' affects set muting when moving to the next set. 'normal' leaves
# the next set muted. 'auto-arm' unmutes it. 'additive' keeps the previous set
# armed when moving to the next set. 'all-sets' arms all sets at once.
#
# 'port-naming': 'short', 'pair', or 'long'. If 'short', the device name is
# shown. If it  is generic, the client name is added for clarity. If 'pair',
# the client:port number is prepended. If 'long', the full set of name items
# is shown. If port-mapping is active (now the default), this does not apply.
#
# 'init-disabled-ports' does not yet work. It tries live toggle of port state.
#
# 'priority' greater than 0 is meant to increase the priority of the I/O
# threads. It needs Seq66 to run as root, or be installed as setuid 0.

realistic for your system.  Also, we add about 8 bogus ports to test the
MIDI Clocks and MIDI Inputs tabs.
