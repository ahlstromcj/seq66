Installed Scripts Directory for Seq66
Chris Ahlstrom
2021-10-12 to 2025-06-07

This directory contains scripts that can be used with JACK and PulseAudio.

jackctl:        The latest attempt to script a JACK startup. Recommended.
startjack:      An older attempt to script a JACK startup.
startqjack:     Another attempt to add scripting to QJackCtl.

pulseaudio:

    These files can be added to the Scripting setup for QJackCtrl so that
    PulseAudio output will be redirected to JACK.  Study them to see if you
    want them.  Will also be documented at some point in the user manual.

        jack-post-start.sh
        jack-post-stop.sh
        jack-pre-start.sh
        jack-pre-stop.sh

    repulse:    Restarts the user-land run of PulseAudio.
