# Seq66 0.99.11 main ('rc') configuration file
#
# /home/user/.config/seq66/seq66cli.rc
# Written 2025-05-26 08:48:41
#
# This file holds the main configuration for Seq66. It diverges greatly from
# the of the seq24rc configuration file.
#
# 'version' is set by Seq66; it is used to detect older configuration files,
# which are upgraded to the new version when saved.
#
# 'quiet' suppresses start-up error messages. Useful when they are not
# relevant. There's no --quiet command-line option yet. It's NOT the opposite
# of 'verbose'.
#
# 'verbose' is temporary, same as --verbose; it's set to false at exit.
#
# 'sets-mode' affects set muting when moving to the next set. 'normal' leaves
# the next set muted. 'auto-arm' unmutes it. 'additive' keeps the previous set
# armed when moving to the next set. 'all-sets' arms all sets at once.
#
# 'port-naming': 'short', 'pair', or 'long'. If 'short', the device name is
# shown; but if generic, the client name is added for clarity. If 'pair',
# the client:port number is prepended. If 'long', the full set of name items
# is shown. If port-mapping is active (now the default), this does not apply.
#
# 'init-disabled-ports' does not yet work. It tries live toggle of port state.
#
# 'priority' greater than 0 is meant to increase the priority of the I/O
# threads. It needs Seq66 to run as root, or be installed as setuid 0.

This is a seq66cli 'rc' file to test basic control and playlist handling.
The 'ctrl' file is a renamed copy of data/samples/nanomap.ctrl.
The 'playlist' file is a renamed copy of data/samples/ca_midi.playlist.
The 'drums' file is a renamed copy of data/samples/GM_DD-11.drums.

# no 'ctrl' file. If none, default keystrokes are used, with no MIDI control.
# Note that all configuration files are stored in the "home" configuration
# directory; any paths in the file-names are stripped.

# Each line shows the bus number and clock status of that bus:
#
#  -2 = Output port is not present on the system (unavailable).

# With Clock Modulo, clocking doesn't begin until song position reaches the
# start-modulo value [midi-clock-mod-ticks]. Ports that are unavailable
# (because another port, e.g. Windows MIDI Mapper, has exclusive access to
# the device) are displayed ghosted. The type of port depends on the

# Patterns use bus numbers, not names. This table provides virtual bus numbers

# system, the pattern will use the proper port. The short nick-names work in
