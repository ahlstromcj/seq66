# This file provides easy-to-use settings for remapping some MIDI events
# so that a MIDI file for a specific device plays back in General MIDI (GM).
# This file consists of one unnamed section and a number of named sections
# as described below.  Note that the 'name' values can be empty, if you don't
# want to key them in.
#
# The unnamed section:
#
#  file-style       The format of the INI file.  Values: 'sectioned' (only).
#  setup-name       Provides a name for the setup, for information only.
#  map-type         Types of maps in this file: 'drum', 'patch', or 'multi'.
#  gm-channel       Indicates the drum channel for GM.  Usually 10.
#  dev-channel      Drum channel for the device.  Some use channel 16.
#  extract-channel  Channel to write to MIDI file.  Other channels dropped.
#  reject-channel   Channel for events to be dropped from the new MIDI file.
#  reverse          Reverse mapping. Usually better as a command-line option.
#  testing          Do the latest developer test.  Command-line preferred.

#
# The patch/program section:
#
#  [Patch 35].      Marks a GM patch-change section, one per program.
#
#  gm-name          GM name of the input patch/program in the input MIDI file.
#  gm-patch         Input patch number representing the named GM instrument.
#  dev-name         Name of the device patch corresponding to th GM MIDI note.
#  dev-patch        GM patch number which best matches the device's sound for
#                   the input patch number.  The gm-patch number is converted
#                   to this patch number to reconstruct the device's sound as
#                   well as possible.
#  gm-equiv         Provides the GM name for the intended replacement. In some
#                   cases, there is no exact GM patch equivalent, so we use
#                   a GM patch that is close enough to the device's patch.
