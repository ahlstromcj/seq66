# The first integer is the color number, ranging from 0 to 31. The
# first string is the name of the background color.  The first

# The second set provides the foreground color name and color.
# The alpha values are not important here, but should be set to FF.

# This section defines brush styles to use.  The names are based on the
# names in the Qt::BrushStyle enumeration. The supported names are:
#
#    nobrush, solid, dense1, dense2, dense3, dense4, dense5, dense6,
#    dense7, horizontal, vertical, cross, bdiag, fdiag, diagcross,
#    lineargradient, radialgradient, and conicalgradient.
#
# For 'empty', best to just use 'solid' (try others and see why).
# For 'note', use 'solid' or the default, 'lineargradient'. These
# also apply to the progress box and triggers.

[brushes]

empty = solid
note = lineargradient
scale = dense3
backseq = dense2

# This section defines pen styles to use for vertical time lines.
# The names are based on the names in the Qt::PenStyle enumeration.
# They are:
#    nopen, solid, dash, dot, dashdot, dashdotdot, customdash (which
#    is currently not supported).
#
# 'measure' and 'beat' are obvious. 'fourth' is a line for the 1/4s of
# a beat, and 'step' is the smallest unit (normally 6 pixels).

measure = solid
beat = solid
fourth = dashdot
step = dot
