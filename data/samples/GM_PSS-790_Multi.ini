# This file provides easy-to-use settings for remapping some MIDI events
# so that a MIDI file for a specific device plays back in General MIDI (GM).
# This file consists of one unnamed section and a number of named sections
# as described below.  Note that the 'name' values can be empty, if you don't
# want to key them in.
#
# The unnamed section:
#
#  file-style       The format of the INI file.  Values: 'sectioned' (only).
#  setup-name       Provides a name for the setup, for information only.
#  map-type         Types of maps in this file: 'drum', 'patch', or 'multi'.
#  gm-channel       Indicates the drum channel for GM.  Usually 10.
#  dev-channel      Drum channel for the device.  Some use channel 16.
#  extract-channel  Channel to write to MIDI file.  Other channels dropped.
#  reject-channel   Channel for events to be dropped from the new MIDI file.
#  reverse          Reverse mapping. Usually better as a command-line option.
#  testing          Do the latest developer test.  Command-line preferred.
#
# The drum section:
#
#  [Drum 35].  Marks a GM drum-change section, one per instrument.
#
#  gm-name          GM name for the drum assigned to the input note.
#  gm-note          Input note number, same as the section number.
#  dev-name         The device's name for the drum represented by the input
#                   note.
#  dev-note         GM MIDI note value whose GM sound best matches the sound
#                   described by dev-name.  The gm-note value is converted to
#                   the dev-note value (unless reverse mapping is activated).
#                   cases, there is no exact GM drum equivalent, so we use
#                   a GM drum that is close enough to the device's drum.
#
# The patch/program section (see below).
