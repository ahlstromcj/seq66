# This file can be used to convert the percussion of non-GM devices
# to GM, as best as permitted by GM percussion. Although it is a
# 'drums' file, it can be used for other note-mappings as well.

This file is based on a similar file created using the "midicvt" application.
It has been manually edited to fit Seq66 conventions.

# This file holds a drum-note mapping configuration for Seq66. It is
# always stored in the configuration directory.  To use this file,
# add this file-name to the '[note-mapper]' section of the 'rc' file.
# There is currently no user interface for managing this file.
# The main values are:
#
#   map-type: drum, patch, or multi; indicates the mapping to do.
#   gm-channel: Indicates the channel (1-16) applied to converted notes.
#   reverse: true or false; map in the opposite direction if true.

# The drum section:
#
#  [Drum 35].  Marks a GM drum-change section, one per instrument.
#
#  gm-name          GM name for the drum assigned to the input note.
#  gm-note          Input note number, same as the section number.
#  dev-name         The device's name for the drum.
#  dev-note         GM MIDI note whose GM sound best matches the sound
#                   of dev-name.  The gm-note value is converted to the
#                   dev-note value (unless reverse mapping is activated).
#                   Note that the actual GM drum sound might not match
#                   what the MIDI hardware puts out.
