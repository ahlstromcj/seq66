                The creation of a new song in <i>Seq66</i> (or any
                sequencer) requires making a number of decisions
                about the song.

                 <li>
                    <b> Time precision. </b>
                    <i>Seq66</i> has a default pulses-per-quarter-note (PPQN)
                    value of 192.
                    This can be changed per-song, or it can be
                    changed globally in the 'usr' file / <i>Preferences</i>.
                    It can range from 32 to 19200, though be aware of the
                    potential impact of high PPQN on playback.
                    Generally, when reading existing tunes, one wants the
                    PPQN of that tune. <i>Seq66</i> will scale time to match.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <b> Live loops versus tracks. </b>
                    A simple yet satisfying song can be made
                    by creating a set of short patterns and letting them
                    play, turning them on and off in a live performance.
                    Or one can make long patterns (tracks) in the same
                    manner as other sequencers.
                    And short patterns (bass, drums) can be combined with long
                    solos.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <b> Time signature. </b>
                    The time signature of a track does not affect the MIDI
                    timing of the track, although it can change the length (in
                    pulses) of the track. The global time signature (in the main
                    window) controls the display of the timing beats in the time
                    bar.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <b> Beats per minute (BPM). </b>
                    This value is read from a MIDI file or specified when
                    creating a new song (in the main window).
                    It can also be set via a "tap BPM" button; click the button in
                    time with some music.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <b> MIDI subsystem. </b>
                    Currently, there are two <i>Linux</i> MIDI subsystems,
                    <i>ALSA</i> and <i>JACK</i>. Either can be used by using the
                    <code>--alsa</code> and <code>--jack</code> options to start
                    <i>qseq66</i>.
                    There is a new subsystem called <i>Pipewire</i>, but
                    currently <i>Seq66</i> doesn't adapt to that.
                    In <i>Windows</i> and <i>Mac OSX</i>, our own version
                    of <i>PortMidi</i> is used.  No one has asked about the 
                    <i>Mac</i>, so that is not tested.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <b> Live play versus "song performance". </b>
                    This question is simple: does one want to control
                    the song during a live performance, or
                    lay it out and export it so that others can read it and
                    play it?
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <b> Other features. </b>
                    Other features include MIDI automation control (e.g.
                    <i>LaunchPad</i>, MIDI status display, set management,
                    play-lists, mute-group management, LFO generation, gross
                    pattern fixes, coloring, style-sheets, fingerprint display,
                    and much more as described in the user's manual.
