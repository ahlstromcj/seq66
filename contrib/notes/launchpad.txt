Quick Reference for Launchpad Mini

2020-08-03 to 2020-08-05

Some of this information was adopted from the PDF file
launchpad-programmers-reference.pdf. That document notes that a Launchpad
message is 3 bytes, and is of type Note Off (80h), Note On (90h), or a
controller change (B0h).  However, on our Mini, we do not receive not offs
(in ALSA)... we receive Note Ons with velocity 0.

The Launchpad Mini has a top row of circular buttons numbered from 1 to 8.
The next 8 rows start with 8 unlabeled square buttons with a circular button on
the right, labelled with letters A through H.

The top row emits 0xB0 ## 0x7f on press, and 0xB0 ## 0x00 on release, where:

    0xB0    Control Change on channel 0 (i.e. channel 1).
    ##      Ranges from 0x68 (104) to 0x6f (111) which are in the range of
            undefined MIDI controllers.

The other buttons issue 0x90 ## 0x7f on press, and 0x90 ## 0x0 on release,
where:

    0x90    Note On message on channel 0 (i.e. channel 1).
    ##      The hex value of the note, as shown by the two-digit hex values
            shown below.

Set Grid LED:      90h key vel (vel = 00GGCKRR)

    "key" is a value given in the active of the two layouts shown above.
    The "vel" bits are: GG for Green brightness, C to clear the LED
    setting of the other buffer, K to copy the data to both buffers, and
    RR for Red brightness.

    Brightness values range from 0 (Off) to 3 (Full).

    Hex MSB  LSB  Color   Brightness

Reset:             B0h 00h 00h
Mapping Mode:      B0h 00h 01h or 02h
Double-buffer:     B0h 00h 20h-3dh (bits: 01CFU0D)
Automap/Live LEDs: x

C = Copy.    Copy LED states from displayed buffer to updating buffer.
F = Flash.   Continually flip displayed buffer to make LEDS flash.
U = Update.  Set buffer 0 or 1 as the updating buffer.
D = Display. Set buffer 0 or 1 as the displaying buffer.

The default state is no Flash; Updating = Displaying = 0; LED data
displayed instantly.  This message also resets the flash timer.

All LEDS On:       B0h 00h 7dh-7fh (low, medium, and full brightness)
                   This command resets all other (see the Reset message).
LED Duty Cycle:    B0h 1e-1fh ND

N = numerator   = 0 to 0fh + 1
D = denominator = 0 to 0fh + 3

If N < 9, send B0h 1eh 10h x N-1 + D-3
Otherwise send B0h 1fh 10h x N-9 + D-3

Automap/Live LEDs: B0h, 68h-6fh data
Rapid LED Update:  92h vel1 vel2

Grid Button Out:   90h key vel (vel = 127 on press, 0 on release)
Auto/Live Button:  B0h 68h-6fh vel (vel = 127 on press, 0 on release)
