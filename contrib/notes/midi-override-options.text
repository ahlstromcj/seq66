Consider a new SeqSpec to hold, in MIDI file, options that
need to override the 'rc' file. A MIDI file that requires ...

    -   "Record by buss".
    -   "Buss override".
    -   "JACK transport".
    -   "Sets mode".
    -   Activating the metronome.

But how would these options be established without a restart?

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=rc
